The goal of this project is to implement a simplistic shoot-em-up-style game in your
terminal. 
I used a ’screen’ made up of a grid of ’squares’, that you can equate to the
characters on your terminal, so that the entities of your game are each represented by a
character on screen.

- Single-player
- Display using the ncurses library
- Vertical scrolling (The screen area moves through the world, very
much like in R-Type for example)
- Random enemies
- The player can shoot at enemies
- Basic collision handling (If an enemy touches you, you die)
- Game entities occupy one ’square’ of the map only
- Frame-based timing
